        <h2><u>About Me:</u></h2>
        <p>
            My name is Amelia Lane, and I am a rising senior at Scarsdale High School. I began coding in eigth grade and I knew this was my passion. I am a very math orientated person, and I love the problem solving aspect in computer science. When I entered my high school I joined a girls coding club, where I found myself to be the only member. I recruited some friends and ended up taking over the club as its president. I have helped to bring in a group of around 15 girls to meet every week. Together we learn the basics of python: creating games like madlibs and number guessing games. Recently I also started a new club where I paired a group of 6th grade girls from Scarsdale and a school in the city called Astoria. Meeting every other week, my partener and I led these girls through projects on scratch to introduce them to the world of computer science, while also forming a new community. We plan on continuing this club in the future.

            There are also many other parts to my life despite coding...

        <h2><u>Family Life</u></h2>

            I am lucky to have an amazing family. My two older brothers, Alex and Joey, and I have always been  extremely close. As both my brothers are in college, I have definitely found it difficult to be home alone all year. However, I do have my dog Felix with me. Felix is a mini golden doodle, although he is not very mini.

            Although clich√©, my parents truly are my role models. My mom works strenuously every day, running her own business. I have watched as she built her business from nothing to where she is today. She has made so much progress, which I am so proud of her for. The most impressive thing about her, is that she always makes time for our family, despite the amount of time she spends working.
